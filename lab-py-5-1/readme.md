# Lab | Customer Analysis Round 1

#### Remember the process:

1. Case Study
2. Get data
3. Cleaning/Wrangling/EDA
4. Processing Data
5. Modeling
6. Validation
7. Reporting

### Abstract

The objective of this data is to understand customer demographics and buying behavior. 

For this lab, we will gather the data from 3 _csv_ files that are provided in the `Data` folder. Use that data and complete the data cleaning tasks as mentioned later in the instructions.

### Instructions

- Read the three files into python as dataframes
- Show the DataFrame's shape.
- Standardize header names.
- Rearrange the columns in the dataframe as needed
- Concatenate the three dataframes
- Which columns are numerical?
- Which columns are categorical?
- Understand the meaning of all columns
- Perform the data cleaning operations mentioned so far in class

  - Delete the column education and the number of open complaints from the dataframe.
  - Correct the values in the column customer lifetime value. They are given as a percent, so multiply them by 100 and change `dtype` to `numerical` type.
  - Check for duplicate rows in the data and remove if any.
  - Filter out the data for customers who have an income of 0 or less.
  - Check and deal with `NaN` values.
  
- Datetime format - Extract the months from the dataset and store in a separate column. Then filter the data to show only the information for the first quarter , ie. January, February and March. _Hint_: If data from March does not exist, consider only January and February.
- BONUS: Put all the previously mentioned data transformations into a function.
